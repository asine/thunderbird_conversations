Thunderbird Conversations
=========================

This extension improves the threaded summary for emails in Thunderbird. It
vastly improves the UI by including some ideas from GMail. More specifically:

* your own messages are displayed in the thread,
* you initially see summaries, they can be expanded to display full messages,
* quoted sections are collapsed Ã  la GMail,
* fast links for replying (and possibly other useful actions),
* you can reply inline (through a "quick reply" feature).

For screenshots and a stable version, please head to
[AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/54035) which should
provide you with a ready-to-install package.

[MDC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Setting_up_extension_development_environment)
to learn how to use a proxy file. If you want to package a release, follow
these steps.

2. Change into the main folder, run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`

This will package an `.xpi` file of the latest codebase which can be installed via add-on manager in Thunderbird.
